# HolySquare
Automatic Holyland Square finder<br>

## Usage
HolySquare will show you a google map with a marker on your estimated location.<br>
On the top of the screen you will find a button saying "Get My Square" - if you are mobile, clicking this button will re-calculate your square based on the new location.<br>
You may also touch (or click) any other point on the map and the application will automatically re-calculate the square for that point.<br>
